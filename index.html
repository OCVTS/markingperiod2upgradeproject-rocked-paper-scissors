                <p>
                    Rocked Paper Scissors is like normal Rock Paper Scissors, but cranked up to 11. It has way more options and a few modifiers that either completely change how the game works, or add even more options.

                <p>
                    I had the flu and was out the week where we focused on this project, so I had to do it mostly at home! I also completely underestimated the scope of the project, causing me to spend a lot less time on it than I should've. A bunch of things had to be scrapped (at least for now) to make the due date. In addition, not all options and modifiers are fully implemented. 
                </p>

                    It was originally a basic Rock Paper Scissors script that ran entirely within the console. After a lot of brainstorming, staying up really late, needless procrastination, and hours of tweaking the tooltip structure to look <em>juuust</em> right, it reached the state of v1.0. Which is very unfinished, but meets the requirements of submission.
